          I started investing and building my portfolio a year ago. For a period of time, I was interested in playing with penny stocks but had no idea where to find them. After discovering a subreddit called [<mark>r/pennystocks</mark>](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/), I would end up reading the subreddit for hours and hours everyday. One day, a reddit user published AutoDD, a python script which counts the number of mentions of a stock ticker on r/pennystocks and present that to the user. Since then, I have added many features and functionalities over the original AutoDD, hence <mark>r/AutoDD-Rev2</mark> was born. Some notable features include adding yahoo finance integration, implementing a scoring system based on upvotes and reddit flair, supporting multiple subreddits, an option to sort results, and an option to output as CSV. The source code is [here](https://github.com/kaito1410/AutoDD_Rev2) and a webapp of the script in action, created by another reddit user is [here](http://unbiastock.com/reddit.php).

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
